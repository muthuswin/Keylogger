# Keylogger for educational purpose

A software keylogger implemented in Python typically involves capturing and recording keystrokes from a keyboard. Its primary purpose is to record everything a user types, which can include usernames, passwords, emails, chat messages, and more.

#Note: Developing, distributing, or using keyloggers without proper authorization may violate laws and ethical guidelines. Always ensure you have appropriate permissions and intentions when working with such software.
